# Intercollegiate Psychedelics Network (IPN)

The Intercollegiate Psychedelics Network (IPN) is a student run umbrella organization that supports collegiate psychedelic student groups and intercollegiate efforts. We strive to support collaboration among college students and envision an academic community that inspires a philosophically motivated and scientifically rigorous study of psychedelics, and more broadly, consciousness; we hope through our work to encourage public awareness of the science, policy, and clinical applications of psychedelics and related substances.

#### The Intercollegiate Psychedelics Network strives to:
- Support member organizations however member organizations define support
- Foster meaningful relationships based on the principles of respect, education, compassion, spiritual growth, emotional wellness, and psychological intimacy with oneself
- Encourage a more nuanced public discourse about the science of psychedelics
- Establish rigorous research trials at member universities
- Further drug decriminalization efforts in service of furthering responsible psychedelics research
- Cultivate mentorship between and amongst students and professiona
